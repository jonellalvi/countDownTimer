//Create a web page that allows the user to set a count down timer value 
e.g. 1 minute that plays a sound and flashes the screen when it counts down 
to zero and indicates progress as the timer counts down.
Bonus points for creativity. 
This is deliberately vague and open to interpretation. 
This is the way we get most assignments from business users.

--------
//investigate SetTimeout (uses millisecs)
//investigate Set Interval (repeats)

// Requirements:
        // 1. User sets time
        // 2. Timer counts down to zero
        // 3. Progress of timer indicated by sound and flash of screen
        // 4. Be Creative
        // 5. It's on a web page

Change so it takes minutes and seconds.
-Completed

------------------------------------
Made the interface prettier
-work in progress!
----------------------------

BUG:
when you don't enter minutes, it returns NaN.
- the problem was when minutes were an empty string
- added a test to make sure it wasn't empty
- fixed
----------------------------

Put the whole thing in a funciton and made it IIFE
-Completed

Add pause button and resume button
-Completed
-------------------------------

Add reset button

Error checking to make sure they entered something

-encountered a bug when entering a digit
it doesn't enable buttons properly -- investigate.
----------------------------------

onKeyPress not working; tried onchange but that only works 
when focus is removed--I think that's the trouble.
-changed to using onkeyup and that seems to have resolved it.

--------------------------------

-work on the display bit
-and cleaning up the code
------------------
