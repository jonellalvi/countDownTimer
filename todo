//Create a web page that allows the user to set a count down timer value 
e.g. 1 minute that plays a sound and flashes the screen when it counts down 
to zero and indicates progress as the timer counts down.
Bonus points for creativity. 
This is deliberately vague and open to interpretation. 
This is the way we get most assignments from business users.
